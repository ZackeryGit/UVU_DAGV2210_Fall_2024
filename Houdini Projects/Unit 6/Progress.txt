I have made a ton of progress on the theme project. I am planning to make a stone beach, with large rocks scattered across the beach, with a cliff that has grass on top of it with tree and maybe bushes and a fence. The progress I've made so far is that I have transformed my grass, fences, rock formation, and trees into digital assets. Wit the grass and rocks, I added a object merge node and added that object field from that into the parameters, so that the grass and rocks can be placed on any plane or object. I did the same thing with the fence, but you are supposed to use a curve node instead for the path it takes. Than with all the objects I added parameters that allow you to modify and change each object to really get what you want. Overall made major progress, and got a sample of what my scene is going to look like!
